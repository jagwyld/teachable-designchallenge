Teachable Product Design Challenge

DESIGN NOTES

Hope you enjoy taking a look at my solution to the design challenge. My general approach to this design problem was to create an experience that is as consistent and predictable as possible. To achieve this, I tried to make the majority of the elements and actions contextual. This means that new items are added inline, can be edited inline, and can be moved via direct manipulation (drag & drop.) Please note that the mockups and all their elements are scaled up, since it looks like they'll be viewed on a TV/large monitor given the size of the artboards.

For the sake of simplicity (and efficiency) I omitted a couple of elements, specifically how photos work. Just to give you an idea of what I had in mind, I was thinking that the product would grab the Gravatar associated with the email address. If no Gravatar exists, then the photo frame would just display the initials of the name. And of course, people could upload their own images (but I didn't document that flow.)

As usual, there are some conditions  and interactions that can't be communicated very well via static mockups. If it's not clear from the mockups, an attendee can be selected (by clicking on it) which makes the name/email/photo editable, and displays the move and delete options. The attendee can be de-selected by clicking anywhere outside of its bounds.

Also worth noting is that the 'Add Attendee' button never scrolls off the screen, it remains in a fixed position (once the header scrolls off) so an attendee can always be added. New attendees are inserted above the first completely visible attendee.

And finally, as an attendee is moved up or down the list, the other attendees jump into position above or below it, leaving a gap in between (as shown in the "Re-ordering attendee" mockup.)

As a part of this design process, I'd typically create interactive prototypes and/or animations in order to better communicate some of these behaviors.

I look forward to discussing this solution further!
